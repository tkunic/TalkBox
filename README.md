# TalkBox

The goal of the TalkBox project is to develop an open-source, open-hardware Speech Generating Device (SGD). It provides non-verbal students in special education a way to build a low-cost, easily configurable SGD with the help of their teacher. The TalkBox project has been developed as a collaboration between the GaMaY Lab at the Lassonde School of Engineering, Ray Feraday and myself.

Please see [here](http://tkunic.github.io/TalkBox) for setup instructions and details.

The `mpr121.py` file is derived from Scott Garner's [Beetbox](http://scott.j38.net/interactive/beetbox/) project, which is in turn based on [an Arduino example](http://bildr.org/2011/05/mpr121_arduino/) by Jim Lindblom. The old TalkBox repository can be found [here](https://github.com/hrairhlessil/TalkBox).

## Workshops

In collaboration with the [Tetra Society of North America](http://www.tetrasociety.org/), the GaMaY lab conducted a [free workshop](http://talkbox.apps01.yorku.ca/?page_id=4890) at the [2014 Toronto Mini Maker Faire](http://makerfairetoronto.com/), in which we helped children with disabilities make and customize their very own TalkBox.
